The components of an Ansible playbook include:

Name: A descriptive name for the playbook, used to identify it in logs and outputs.

Hosts: The target hosts or groups of hosts on which the playbook will be executed. Hosts can be specified using various patterns, such as individual hostnames, IP addresses, or group names defined in the inventory.

Variables: Playbook-level variables that are used to configure tasks within the playbook. These variables can be defined directly within the playbook or referenced from external variable files.

Tasks: The individual units of work that are performed on the target hosts. Tasks are defined as a list of actions to be executed, such as installing packages, copying files, or starting services.

Handlers: Handlers are similar to tasks but are only executed if notified by another task. They are typically used to handle service restarts or other actions that need to be triggered in response to a change.

Roles: Roles are a way to organize and reuse tasks, variables, and handlers. They provide a structured approach to managing complex configurations and allow for modular and reusable code.

Conditionals: Conditionals allow you to control the execution of tasks based on specific conditions. You can use conditionals to skip tasks, include or exclude certain tasks based on variables or facts, or perform different actions based on the state of the target hosts.

Loops: Loops enable you to iterate over a list of items and perform the same task multiple times with different values. Loops can be used to create multiple users, install multiple packages, or configure multiple resources.

Tags: Tags provide a way to selectively run specific tasks within a playbook. You can assign tags to tasks and then use those tags to control which tasks are executed.

Playbook Execution: The playbook is executed using the ansible-playbook command, specifying the playbook file and any additional options or variables required.
