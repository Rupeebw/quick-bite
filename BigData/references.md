Hadoop Cluster Demos

To setup your own cluster (see the Hadoop installation), you need to install software.

This page gives you all the links to the material. You don't need to install it yet, I'll show you the demo in one of the demo lectures in the first section of the course.
Multi-node cluster

If you have enough memory in your machine (8GB+) you can use the multi-node cluster using vagrant. This is the preferred setup and this will closely align to the demos I will show you.

Single-node cluster

If you don't have a powerful machine, you can also use the single-node sandbox from the Hortonworks website. This is not the preferred way. Try the multi-node cluster first. This is an alternative if you don't have enough memory in your machine. The cluster will already be installed for you. You can use this to test the code examples, but you'll not be able to do the installation yourself.
