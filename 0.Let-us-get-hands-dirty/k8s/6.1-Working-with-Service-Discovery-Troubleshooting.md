  Service registration and discovery involves a lot of moving parts. If a single one of them stops working, the whole process can potentially break. Let’s quickly run through what needs to be working and how to check them.

Kubernetes uses the cluster DNS as its service registry. It runs as a set of Pods in the kube-system Namespace, with a Service object providing a stable network endpoint. The important components are:

    Pods: managed by the coredns Deployment
    Service: a ClusterIP Service called kube-dns listening on port 53 TCP/UDP
    Endpoint: also called kube-dns

All objects relating to the cluster DNS are tagged with the k8s-app=kube-dns label. This is helpful when filtering kubectl output.

<summary>Step two: check the Service and associated Endpoints object</summary>
<br>

  Assuming the Pods and Deployment are working, you should also check the Service and associated Endpoints object. The output should show that the service is up, has an IP address in the ClusterIP field, and is listening on port 53 TCP/UDP.

The ClusterIP address for the kube-dns Service should match the IP address in the /etc/resolv.conf files of all containers running on the cluster. If the IP addresses are different, containers will send DNS requests to the wrong IP address.

<summary>Step three: perform in-depth troubleshooting</summary>
<br>

  Once you’ve verified the fundamental DNS components are up and working, you can proceed to perform more detailed and in-depth troubleshooting. Here are a few basic tips:

Start a troubleshooting Pod that has your favourite networking tools installed (ping, traceroute, curl, dig, nslookup, etc.). The standard gcr.io/kubernetes-e2e-test-images/dnsutils:1.3 image is a popular choice if you don’t have your own custom image with your tools installed. Unfortunately, there is no latest image in the repo. This means you have to specify a version. At the time of writing, 1.3 was the latest version.

The following command will start a new stand-alone Pod, called netutils, based on the dnsutils image just mentioned. It will also log your terminal on to it.
