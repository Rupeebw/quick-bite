  The basic steps of the demo will be:

    Create a StorageClass.
    Create a PVC.
    Create a Pod that leverages it all.

The Pod will map a volume using the PVC, which, in turn, will trigger the SC to dynamically create a PV and associated external storage asset. The demo will be on the Google Cloud Platform and assumes you have a working cluster with kubectl correctly configured.
Clean up#

If you’ve been following along, you’ll have a Pod, a PVC, and a PV already created. Let’s delete these before proceeding with the demo.
```
  $ kubectl delete pods volpod
pod "volpod" deleted

$ kubectl delete pvc pvc1
persistentvolumeclaim "pvc1" deleted

$ kubectl delete pv pv1
persistentvolume "pv1" deleted
```

<summary>Create a StorageClass</summary>
<br>

  We’ll use the following YAML to create a StorageClass, called “slow”, based on Google GCE standard persistent disks. We won’t get into the details of the storage back end, but, suffice to say, it’s a slow tier of disk. The YAML also sets the reclaim policy so that data will not be lost when PVC bindings are released. Finally, it uses an annotation to attempt to set this as the default storage class on the cluster.

Here’s the YAML file; it’s called google-sc.yml.
  ```
  kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: slow
  annotations:
    storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
provisioner: kubernetes.io/gce-pd
parameters:
  type: pd-standard
reclaimPolicy: Retain
  ```
  
  Two things to note before you deploy the SC:

    This lab was tested on Kubernetes 1.16.2
    Setting default storage classes on the tested version of Kubernetes is done via an annotation. This is likely to change in future versions.

Deploy the SC with the following command:

<summary>Create a PVC</summary>
<br>

  Use the following YAML to create a PVC object that references the slow StorageClass created in the previous step. The YAML is called google-pvc.yml.
  ```
  apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pv-ticket
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: slow
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 25Gi
  ```

  Notice that the PVC is already bound to the pvc-881a23... volume – you didn’t have to manually create a PV. The mechanics behind the operation are as follows:

    You created the slow StorageClass.
    A loop was created to watch the API server for new PVCs referencing the slow StorageClass.
    You created the pv-ticket PVC that requested binding to a 25GB volume from the slow StorageClass.
    The StorageClass loop noticed this PVC and dynamically created the requested PV.

Use the following command to verify the presence of the automatically created PV on the cluster.

<summary>Create a pod</summary>
<br>

  ```
  apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: class-pod
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: data
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: pv-ticket
  containers:
  - name: ubuntu-ctr
    image: ubuntu:latest
    command:
    - /bin/bash
    - "-c"
    - "sleep 60m"
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /data
      name: data
  ```
  
  Deploy the Pod with kubectl apply -f google-pod.yml.

Congratulations. You’ve deployed a new default StorageClass and used a PVC to dynamically create a PV. You also have a Pod that has mounted the PVC as a volume in a container.
Clean up#

If you’ve followed along with the demo, you’ll have a Pod, called “class-pod,” with a volume using the “pv-ticket” PVC that was dynamically created via the “slow” SC. The following commands will delete all of these objects.
