<summary>Task 9: Deploy the Chart</summary>
<br>

  Once you have edited all the essential fields, it’s time to move ahead and deploy the application.

Your task is to:

    Install the Helm chart.
    Verify the Pod status.

Since Helm uses the name as the key, you cannot install two applications with the same name in the same namespace. This means that if the installation fails, you need to re-install your chart with a different name.

    Note: Please verify that the Pod is in a running state before moving to the next task.
 
  > helm install your-app-name your-chart-name
  >  helm install demosite sample-app

<summary>Task 10: Access the Application</summary>
<br>
In the final step of the project, you’ll access your already deployed application over the internet.

Your task is to:

    Check the status of your Service.
    Access your internal Kubernetes application over the internet. To do that, map your Service port to 31111.

Verify the application is running by using the browser. Refresh the browser for this purpose.
  
  

    Use below command to check the status of your Service.
    > kubectl get service

    Use the following command to map your Service to your localhost:
    > kubectl port-forward svc/demosite-sample-app --address 0.0.0.0 31111:31111
