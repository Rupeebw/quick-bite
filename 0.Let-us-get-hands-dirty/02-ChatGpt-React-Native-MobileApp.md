  Here are the steps to build an Instagram feed mobile app from scratch using popular JavaScript libraries:

Choose a framework: Select a popular framework for building cross-platform mobile apps, such as React Native or Ionic.

Set up the development environment: Install Node.js, npm, and the chosen framework on your computer.

Choose libraries: Consider using libraries such as Axios for making HTTP requests, React Native Elements for UI components, and React Navigation for navigation.

Design the app: Decide on the overall layout and functionality of your app, including the feed page, profile page, and story page.

Create a data page: Set up a data page in JSON format to store the articles, profile, and story information for the app.

Implement the components: Write code to display the feed, profile, and story components, and make API calls to retrieve the data from the data page.

Test and debug: Test the app on a simulator or physical device to catch any bugs, and make any necessary fixes.

Publish the app: Once you are satisfied with the app's performance and functionality, you can publish it on the App Store or Google Play Store.

Note: These steps are just a general guideline, and the actual steps may vary depending on the chosen framework, libraries, and design.
